    "### __1- How can we add new data in Tableau? (excel, csv, pdf etc.) :__\n",
    "\n",
    "You can upload files with “Connect” in Tableau. You can upload an excel file, csv file, pdf file etc. or you can connect to a server. When you open Tableau you’ll see a page that is for adding new data and check on your works. You can click the true menu for adding your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Menu_of_Tableau_upload_files.png\" alt=\"Menu_of_Tableau\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### __2- To which things we should pay attention while we are adding new data?__ \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, you should check all columns at source database and Tableau. Are there all columns in the data source menu? If they are, you should check their types. If their types are wrong you should change with true types. \n",
    "You can change types from type’s mark option. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should check row counts for each table. It is very important while joining tables. Joining tables may cause duplicate rows which is problematic at reporting and analysis. \n",
    " \n",
    "### __3- How can we create a new worksheet?__  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you added your data correctly, you can directly start working with data. Firstly you should open a new worksheet. Then you can see the ‘New Worksheet’ menu at the below. If you click it, a new worksheet will open immediately. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"how can open new worksheet.png\" alt=\"how can open new worksheet\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### __4-  Taking a glance at worksheet__ \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"worksheet.png\" alt=\"worksheet\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open the worksheet, you’ll see 4 different sections.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First section is used for working on details. You can find all the Tableau features which help us to use Tableau efficiently in this menu. For example; save, calculated field, aggregation, format, shortcut menu bar etc are one of the features you can directly use. \n",
    "Second area is used for analysing data source’s columns and their details. It shows data source’s  columns as dimensions and measures which I will tell more about in the next sections. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of features such as filtering, colouring and writing text in the third section.  \n",
    "Last area is called the working area. It is used for creating charts or maps. You can use columns and rows for creating charts. \n",
    "\n",
    "### __5- What are the dimensions and the measures?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau separates columns of the data into two groups dimensions and measures. Dimensions contain categorical variables like string, date or geographic values. Measures contain numeric variables. Dimensions are independent  variables. Measures are dependent  variables.  Dimensions’s colour is blue, measures’s colour is green. You can easily use measure value on dimensions or vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "### __6- Creating a new chart__\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a new chart is very easy. You drag and drop a column at dimensions or measures section into columns or rows section. Tableau automatically creates a bar or line chart. \n",
    "For example you can see a link that is a bar chart about items’s amount as regions below. \n",
    "https://public.Tableau.com/views/temssAmountasRegions/temssAmountasRegions?:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"A Bar Chart-1.png\" alt=\"A Bar Chart-1\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### __7- How can we use the Marks menu?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, creating a bar chart is very easy but you should add something on your chart. For example, you can add text, you can change colour, you can add detail value etc. In order to create these effects you should use ‘Marks Area’.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below there is a bar chart about items’s amount grouped by regions. If you want to see the amount on bars, as labels, you should drag unit on bar chart or if you want to change colours by regions, you should drag region variable on colour in ‘Marks’. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"A Bar Chart.png\" alt=\"A Bar Chart\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### __8- How can we use Filters and quick filter?__\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to show all data on your chart you can use filters or you can show the data by year or month on your chart by using filters. \n",
    "For example we want to filter the data set by time. We should drag and drop the order date variable on the filter area and then a page will be opened. Tableau gives some options about our filter and asks us, ‘what do you want with this value?’. We should choose date type as year, month, day, etc. After choosing, our bar chart doesn’t change.  In order to activate filters we should choose ‘show filter’ in filters area and then filters will appear like below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"filters.png\" alt=\"filters\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes data may be very big and it seems very ugly on a worksheet. We should prepare this area with quick filter pop up like below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"filters 2.png\" alt=\"filters 2\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you change the month with a quick filter bar chart will change. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chart above is August 2014 and chart below is April 2015 charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"unnamed_.jpg\" alt=\"unnamed\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### __9- Taking a glance at ‘show me’ menu__\n",
    "\n",
    "Show me Menu shows all charts and their necessities. For example, what is needed to create a bar chart, treemap or scatter plot? \n",
    "Regarding the columns used at the working section, usable charts will change at the right selection menu. If you want to use a specific chart which is blurred on the right section, you should change your data on the working area. \n",
    "\n",
    "### __10- Working with time series__\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have time series data you can analyze it with a line chart. For example, you have data about the count of unemployed people by time and you want to visualise it. You should drag and drop the time variable and unemployed variable in the working area. Tableau will prepare a line chart. But you should pay attention to the date type. Tableau shows it as a year type. But if you don’t want to use it as a year type then you should change it.\n",
    " \n",
    "There are two different types of sections about how to use the date column. One of them is comprised of year, month, quarter, day. If you have different years with different months or quarters in the data set, this option will not identify years and will only visualise month or quarters. At the charts we can’t see which month or quarter belongs to which year. So you need more details such as months + years, quarters + years, days +years. In order to achieve this you should use the second section.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see a link that is a line chart about the count of unemployed people by time below. \n",
    "https://public.Tableau.com/views/CountofUnemployedPeoplebyTime/CountofUnemployedPeoplebyTime?:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link  \n",
    "\n",
    "### __11-What are aggregation and granularity?__ \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you add a measure to your working area, an aggregation is applied to that measure by default. This default property is controlled by the Aggregate Measures setting in the Analysis menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to see all of the marks in the view at the most detailed level of granularity, you can disaggregate the view. Disaggregating your data means that Tableau will display a separate mark for every data value in every row of your data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __12- Creating Scatter plot__\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter plots’s primary usage is to observe and show relationships between two numeric variables. The dots in a scatter plot not only report the values of individual data points, but also show patterns of the relationship for example positive or negative relationship. So, a scatter plot can also be useful for identifying patterns in data set. We can divide data points into groups based on how closely sets of points cluster together. Scatter plots can also show if there are any unexpected gaps in the data and if there are any outlier points. This can be useful if we want to segment the data into different parts, like in the development of user personas. You can see a link that is a scatter plot showing the relationship between sales and profit below.\n",
    "https://public.Tableau.com/views/CustomerScatterPlot_15803070925390/CustomerScatterPlot?:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link \n",
    "\n",
    "### __13- How can we work with multiple worksheets?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, the real question is how we can connect multiple worksheets with filters? If one of them has a filter how can we add this filter in another worksheets? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a bar chart with a filter on it and you also want to use the same filter on other charts or maps, you have two options,\n",
    " \n",
    "One way is, you can create the same filter on other charts. If you use this option, you can’t connect charts or maps on the same filter. So each chart or map will not be filtered together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second way is you can use the same filter on all charts and maps. If you use this optıion, you can connect charts and maps on the same filter. For example, if you choose 2014 year value at a chart, other chart’s year will be filtered as the first chart filter. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use this feature you should click on filter at one of the charts. And then you should click ‘Apply to worksheet’. Many options will be opened. You can choose whatever you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "### __14- How can we join tables at Tableau?__\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two or more different data tables or files, we can use join or data blending. Joining is very easy at Tableau. For example, we have two excel pages and we want to join them in Tableau. First step is, we should add the file in a normal way. And then we should drag and drop one of the pages on the data working area. After this, you should drag and drop the other page to the left side of the first page. Which one we choose first table is so important. Because if you want to do left join you must select the page or table to be the main data source which has all the data we want to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you drag and drop all pages or tables, Tableau will do inner join as default optıion. But you can change the join type when you click on the mark which shows join options. And if you want to change primary keys that are being used for joining or you want to add new keys this section will help you to do that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Join types can be summarized as following;\n",
    "\n",
    "(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables\n",
    "LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table\n",
    "RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table\n",
    "FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table\n",
    "\n",
    "🔺Use joins when;\n",
    "➻Combining data at the row level. \n",
    "\n",
    "### __15- What is Data Blending?__\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a table that was joined and if you want to join this table with a new table you should use data blending. Because we may have duplicate values with join action,. \n",
    "A blend is like a smart join \"on the fly\". Data blending is a left join. \n",
    "Common fields with the same name are picked up automatically as the blend clause. \n",
    "Blending occurs at the granularity of your view. \n",
    "Aggregation happens before the blend. \n",
    "Blend is unique to each worksheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "🔺Use blendings when; \n",
    " ➻Datasource have different levels of granularity\n",
    " ➻Datasource come from different systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "For making data blending; \n",
    "You should join two tables with normal joining. And then you should click Tableau’s mark under field for adding a new table. And you should select your new file. After that, you will see two different data sources at your worksheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should select the data source that you want to use. After you select, you will see columns of this data source. If you want to see relationships and add new relationships you should follow the steps below. \n",
    "\n",
    "➻ Data ⟶ Edit relationships ⟶ A page will open ⟶ You can see all relationships ⟶ if you select custom, the add button will be active ⟶ new page will open ⟶ you can add new relationships ⤵\n",
    "\n",
    "### __16- What is a data interpreter?__\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a file that has empty rows or columns, you can use “use data interpreter”. This function shows how your data should be seen. And it cleans your data. But you should check your data whether it is cleaned correctly or not. \n",
    "If you think your data cleaning is wrong, then you should prepare your data for Tableau again. At the example below we can see the wrong format on the left side and correct format on the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __17-Creating Dual axis charts__\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different ways to compare multiple measures in a single view. One of them is a dual axis chart. \n",
    "I’ll explain this chart with an example. I have data about monthly sales values and monthly target values.  I have 3 categories. I want to see both of them on the same chart. I should follow a way like below;\n",
    "\n",
    "I should prepare bar charts about monthly sales price as product category. And then I should add target values the same row. I’ll have 6 charts on the working area. Three of them are for sales, others are for targets.  I should right click a target chart and select “dual axis”. After that, I’ll have three charts. But my charts seem like below. \n",
    "\n",
    "I should right click on target at this level. And I should select “synchronize axis”. Because row values of sales should be row values of targets. \n",
    "And finally my charts seem like below;\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about dual axis chart, you can read this page. \n",
    "https://help.Tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/multiple_measures.htm \n",
    "\n",
    "### __18- Creating calculated columns (in single data source and data blending)__\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating calculated columns is a very simple and useful function. If you need a column that is formed by two or more columns, you can use calculated columns. For example, I have a unit column and unit price column and I need a total price column. I can create new column with calculation (unit* unit price).\n",
    "\n",
    "➻ You should right click on the measure area. And then you should select ‘Create calculated field’. A page will open. And you should type your calculation. You can type a new name. \n",
    "\n",
    "### __19- Creating map__\n",
    "\n",
    "Geographic data seems like this symbol at Tableau. If you have a geographic column you should just drag and drop it on the working area. Tableau will map automatically. But sometimes Tableau doesn’t find states or cities on the map. Tableau shows a message on the right of the map like “1 unknown”. You should click the message. Tableau gives three options to us like below. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should click “edit locations” firstly for looking at unknown cities.if you know city locations you can edit locations. If you don’t know that, you can filter data or hide messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see a link that is a map. \n",
    "https://public.Tableau.com/profile/elif.karakutuk.dinc#!/vizhome/DashbordofUdemyCourse/Dashboard1\n",
    "\n",
    "### __20- How can we create a new dashboard?__\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have two or more worksheets you can create a new dashboard. You should click new dashboard’s mark on Tableau. (you can see it in the photo below). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can decide dashboard size with size menu. You can work for tablet, desktop or automatic size. \n",
    "You can add a web page, text, image in your dashboard. \n",
    "You can see an example dashboard when you click the link below. \n",
    "https://public.Tableau.com/views/DashbordofUdemyCourse/Dashboard1?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link \n",
    "https://public.Tableau.com/views/DashboardofLesson/Dashboard1?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link \n",
    "\n",
    "### __21- How can we use the same filters in the dashboard?__\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some things to consider when working with the dashboard. For example;\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add all worksheets you should pay attention to filters. Because we can use the same filters at worksheets. And we should connect all of them to the dashboard. You should click both of the filter's mark on the worksheets. Therefore, when you click the value of one chart, the other chart shows its own value based on the same value. \n",
    "\n",
    "### __22- How can we create a new storyline?__ \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have one or more worksheets or dashboards you can create a new dashboard. You should click the new story’s mark on Tableau. (you can see it in the photo below). \n",
    "And you can see all worksheets and dashboards on the right menu. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should use one worksheet or dashboard at the same story. So, you should put all of them at different story pages. \n",
    "If you want to add a new story page, you should click ‘Blank’ on the right menu.\n",
    "If you want to add the same story page that you used before, you should click ‘duplicate’ on the right menu.\n",
    "You can add titles above of pages. \n",
    "You can add an explanation on charts for a value. You should select the value and then you should right click on value. You should “annotate”. \n",
    "You can see an example story when you click the link below. \n",
